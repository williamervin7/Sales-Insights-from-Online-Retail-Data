# üöÄ E-Commerce Data Analysis and Insights

This multi-notebook project provides an in-depth analysis of a UK-based online retail dataset (2010-2011). Beyond exploratory data analysis, it delves into **statistical hypothesis testing** to uncover actionable business insights regarding customer behavior, revenue distribution, and sales trends. The project is designed with modularity, demonstrating various stages of a data science workflow.

## üìö Project Structure

This project is organized into several Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on a distinct phase of the data analysis and modeling pipeline:

1.  **`1_sales_insights_from_online_retail_data.ipynb`**: Focuses on initial data understanding, cleaning, and creating new features.
2.  **`2_sales_insights_from_online_retail_Stats.ipynb`**: Conducts rigorous statistical tests to validate observations and uncover significant differences in key business metrics.
3.  **`3_Data_Pipeline_and_Preparation.ipynb`**: (Future Notebook) Details the construction of a robust data pipeline for preprocessing and feature engineering.
4.  **`4_Customer_Segmentation_and_Modeling.ipynb`**: (Future Notebook) Explores machine learning models for customer segmentation or predictive analytics.

## üì¶ Dataset

-   **Source**: [Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/online-retail-customer-clustering) (Kaggle)
-   **Records**: Approximately 541,909 transactions from December 2010 to December 2011.
-   **Key Fields**: `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (from `sales_insights_from_online_retail_data.ipynb`)

Initial data preparation and creation of new analytical features:

-   Converted `InvoiceDate` to datetime format.
-   Handled missing `CustomerID` entries.
-   Filtered out invalid transactions (e.g., non-positive `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`).
-   Calculated `TotalPrice` (`Quantity` √ó `UnitPrice`) for each transaction.
-   Engineered temporal features (`Weektype` - Weekend/Weekday) and customer-level aggregates (e.g., `Purchase Frequency`, `Total Revenue per Customer`).

## üìà Key Insights & Statistical Findings (from `2_sales_insights_from_online_retail_Stats.ipynb`)

This notebook validates initial observations and explores deeper relationships using rigorous statistical methods.

### 1. Revenue Distribution & Customer Segmentation

-   Analyzed overall revenue distribution, identifying heavy right-skewness.
-   **Insight**: Applied **log transformation** to normalize revenue data for robust statistical analysis.
-   **Statistical Tests**:
    * **Hypothesis: Weekend vs. Weekday Revenue**: Investigated if average transaction revenue differs between weekends and weekdays.
        * **Methodology**: Independent two-sample t-test (Student's or **Welch's, based on Levene's Test for equal variances**).
        * **Key Finding**: Found a statistically significant (p < 0.001) but practically small (Cohen's d = 0.21) difference, with weekday transactions having slightly higher average revenue.
    * **Hypothesis: Top Customers vs. Other Customers (Revenue)**: Compared the average transaction revenue of top-tier customers against others.
        * **Methodology**: Independent two-sample t-test (with variance check).
        * **Key Finding**: Confirmed Top Customers have significantly higher average transaction revenue (p < 0.001) with a substantial effect size (Cohen's d = 0.2114).
    * **Hypothesis: Top Customers vs. Other Customers (Purchase Frequency)**: Assessed if top customers have higher purchase frequencies.
        * **Methodology**: Independent two-sample t-test (with variance check).
        * **Key Finding**: Identified a highly significant difference (p < 0.001) and small effect (Cohen's d = 0.2114), indicating Top Customers purchase more frequently.

### 2. Revenue by Country

-   Compared average revenue across different countries to identify regional performance variations.
-   ** Methodology** Utilized **Kruskal-Wallis H-test** (as ANOVA assumptions were violated) to compare means across multiple groups.
-   **Conclusion** There is a statistically significant difference in median LogRevenue among the countries (p < 0.05) with a Test Statistic of: 17927.7304

### 3. Revenue Distribution via Bootstrapping

-   Explored the sampling distribution of key revenue metrics to understand their variability and construct non-parametric confidence intervals.
-   **Methodology** Applied **Bootstrapping** to simulate sampling distributions and derive robust confidence intervals without strong distributional assumptions.
-   **Key Findings** There is no statistically significant evidence that the average revenue per transaction is different from the overall observed mean.
-   The hypothesized mean revenue of 22.40 falls within the 95% confidence interval.

## üìà Visualizations Used

A combination of plots to illustrate data distributions and test results:

-   Histograms (for distribution visualization, including log-transformed data)
-   Box Plots (for comparing group distributions and identifying outliers)
-   (Add others as you use them: Scatter plots, bar charts for product analysis, etc.)
